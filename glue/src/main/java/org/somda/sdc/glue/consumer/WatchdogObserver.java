 * Listens to a Watchdog and receives information if something goes wrong.

 * with a {@link org.somda.sdc.glue.consumer.event.WatchdogMessage} object and subscribe at an {@link SdcRemoteDevice}.
 * Watchdog Events are distributed asynchronously, however it is recommended to block the
 * delivering thread as little as possible.
